# **Hashing: A Comprehensive Guide**

Hashing is a technique used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values using a hash function. It is widely used in scenarios such as dictionary lookups, caching, and more.

---

## **1. Basics of Hashing**

### **1.1 What is Hashing?**
Hashing transforms input (keys) into a fixed-size value, typically represented as an index in a hash table.

- **Hash Function**: A function \( h(x) \) that maps keys to indices in a hash table.
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing for quick access.

---

## **2. Properties of a Good Hash Function**
1. **Deterministic**: Same input should always produce the same hash.
2. **Uniform Distribution**: Keys should be distributed evenly across the hash table.
3. **Minimized Collisions**: Reduce the likelihood of multiple keys mapping to the same hash value.
4. **Fast Computation**: Hashing should be computationally inexpensive.

---

## **3. Types of Hash Functions**

### **3.1 Division Method**
- Formula: \( h(k) = k \mod m \)
- \( m \) should ideally be a prime number.

### **3.2 Multiplication Method**
- Formula: \( h(k) = \lfloor m \cdot (kA \mod 1) floor \), where \( A \) is a constant \( (0 < A < 1) \).

### **3.3 Cryptographic Hash Functions**
- Examples: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.
- Designed to be collision-resistant and secure.

### **3.4 Universal Hashing**
- Randomly selects a hash function from a family of functions to minimize collisions.

## **4. Collision and Collision Resolution**

### **4.1 What are Collisions?**
A collision occurs when two keys map to the same index in the hash table.

### **4.2 Collision Resolution Techniques**
1. **Chaining (Separate Chaining)**: Use a linked list or dynamic array at each index to store multiple values.
2. **Open Addressing**: Probes for the next available slot. Includes:
   - **Linear Probing**
   - **Quadratic Probing**
   - **Double Hashing**
3. **Perfect Hashing**: Uses two levels of hash tables to achieve collision-free operations.
4. **Robin Hood Hashing**: Balances probe lengths by stealing slots from farther keys.

## **5. Time Complexity**

| Operation   | Average Case | Worst Case (with collisions) |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Search      | \( O(1) \)   | \( O(n) \)                  |
| Insertion   | \( O(1) \)   | \( O(n) \)                  |
| Deletion    | \( O(1) \)   | \( O(n) \)                  |

---

## **6. Space Complexity**

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the hash table.

---

## **7. Load Factor and Rehashing**

- **Load Factor**: \( lpha = rac{	ext{Number of elements}}{	ext{Size of table}} \).
- When \( lpha \) exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.75), **rehashing** is triggered:
  1. Create a new hash table of larger size.
  2. Reinsert all keys.

---

## **8. Hash Table Optimizations**

1. **Dynamic Resizing**: Adjust table size based on load factor.
2. **Double Hashing**: Use a secondary hash function to handle collisions.
3. **Cache Optimization**: Align data with CPU cache lines for better performance.

---

## **9. Advanced Topics**

### **9.1 Consistent Hashing**
- Used in distributed systems to minimize disruption when nodes are added/removed.
- Example: Load balancing.

### **9.2 Hash Trees (Merkle Trees)**
- Hierarchical data structure where each node is a hash of its children.
- Example: Blockchain.

### **9.3 Bloom Filters**
- Space-efficient probabilistic structure to test membership.
- **Applications**: Spell checkers, databases.

### **9.4 Cuckoo Hashing**
- Two hash functions, two tables. On collision, an item is "kicked out" and rehashed.

---

## **10. Applications of Hashing**

1. **Dictionaries/Hash Maps**: Fast key-value storage.
2. **Password Storage**: Cryptographic hashing ensures security.
3. **Database Indexing**: Accelerates queries.
4. **Data Deduplication**: Identifies duplicate files/data.

---

## **11. Common Challenges and Solutions**

### **11.1 High Collision Rate**
- **Solution**: Use a better hash function or resize the table.

### **11.2 Inefficient Hash Function**
- **Solution**: Replace with a domain-specific hash function.

### **11.3 Memory Overhead**
- **Solution**: Optimize load factor and use smaller auxiliary structures.
